# Canonical Take Home Test

## Installing the project

In the root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The server can be accessed at http://localhost:3000.

## Potential changes

These are a list of things that I would change/improve. This is not a comprehensive list.

- Lazy load images (must).
- Compute and add width/height attributes for images to prevent layout shift (must).
- Internationalization (must).
- Adjust HTML elements for cards to be section/article for accessibility (optional).
- Change color of top border of cards to match the header text. So People and Culture would be purple, and Canonical Announcements could be blue (optional).
- Change credit text to be aligned at the bottom of the card instead of directly below the title (optional).
- Adjust appearance of cards on tablet-sized screens. They may appear too large to some people (optional).
